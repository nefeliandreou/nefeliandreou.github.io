I'm an Applied Scientist specializing in Generative AI, Multimodal Learning, and techniques 
for bridging the gap between 2D and 3D to advance the development of Virtual Humans. 
I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Early Stage Researcher as part of the 
[ITN-CLIPE](https://www.clipe-itn.eu/) project, and a PhD candidate at the
 [University of Cyprus](http://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/), under the supervision of
  Professor [Yiorgos Chrysanthou](https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~yiorgos/). 
I've had the opportunity to collaborate with leading institutions such as Amazon, 
École Polytechnique, and the Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.
My background includes an MSc in Data Science and BSc in Mathematics from the
 [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/).
