I am an Applied Scientist specializing in Generative AI, Multimodal Learning, and techniques 
for bridging the gap between 2D and 3D to advance the development of Virtual Humans. 

I have obtained my PhD on "Multimodal Generation of Realistic Human Bodies" as part of [ITN-CLIPE](https://www.clipe-itn.eu/), a Marie Skłodowska-Curie project that was funded by the EU and addressed core challenges in the creation and control of interactive virtual characters in immersive environments. 
  
I have been a visiting researcher at Amazon, École Polytechnique, and the Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.
Previously, I have completed an MSc in Data Science and BSc in Mathematics from the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/).
