      "summary": "In this work, we address the fundamental problem of finding a robust pose representation for motion, suitable for deep skeletal animation, one that can better constrain poses and faithfully capture nuances correlated with skeletal characteristics. We propose a novel representation based on dual quaternions and show experimentally superior results in terms of training convergence and perceived realism of generated motions."
